# meipian-crawler
One-off scripts to crawl meipian.cn. No future updates. Use at your own risk. 

## What this is
This is a repo of throw-away scripts I made to back up meipian posts. The repo is public only so others can get inspirations. 

## What this is not
This is not some tools you use in production. There is no test, very little comments, and a loose code structure (to be used as individual scripts). I didn't add much error handling and you will need to add your own logic if you want to skip and reuse previous progress (when you request got timed out for reasons).

## Why
A very close relative of mine passed away early this year. He loved photography and had many posts on 美篇 https://www.meipian.cn.  

美篇, likes many social media platforms, acts like a gated garden. It's easy to post content there but not so easy if you back up posts. 

### How About Wayback Machine
Tried. Archived around 14 posts before wayback machine's IP got blocked and can no longer connect to meipian.cn anymore. I also encountered rate limitations during developing this script, or it's just Comcast being a crappy ISP.
